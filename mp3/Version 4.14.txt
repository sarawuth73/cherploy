- Can now be activated:
- Surround yourself in a 250 radius sphere that passively pushes enemies back for the duration.
- Mana cost: 55
- Cooldown: 23/21/19/17 seconds
- Duration: 1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds


+ A QoL change to Zephyr’s early game alongside some added utility to his kit to synergize with the other abilities.






= Items =






Abyssal Skull
- No longer grants 10% lifesteal to ranged units.


+ This change will disincentivize ranged carries to buy this early game and further promote the eventual build-into of a Sinner’s Inscription to supportive heroes.


Arcane Bomb - Rework
- Changed how the item works to the following:
- After a 0.5 second delay, create a 600 unit radius Burning Field at a point that’s within 1200 range that lasts for 5 seconds. Enemies inside receive 40 Magic Damage per second. Player-controlled units and illusions receive an additional damage equal to 10% of their Max Health.


+ Changes made to this item aim to minimize hard-countering illusion based heroes while still providing counter-play to the frustration of illusion spam abilities. Illusions will take noticeable damage within the area, making it easier to differentiate which hero is fake versus real, while giving time to the illusion-controlling hero to react to the effects.


Brutalizer
- Component buildup changed to: Broadsword (1200) + Halberd (1000) + Bolstering Armband (450) + Recipe (400).
* Total cost remains the same (3050).
- Damage increased from 25 to 30.
- Bash proc damage reduced from 85 to 65.


+ Previously having 2 Halberds was counter-intuitive as the proc effects don’t work together.


Dreamcatcher
- Component buildup changed to: Soul Trap (600) + Blood Ruby (550) + Apprentice’s Robe (450) + Recipe (800).
* Total cost increased from 2150 to 2400 gold.
- Intelligence increased from +6 to +12.
- No longer grants +20 Movement speed.


+ Another cost increase should put this item more in-line with its effects in addition to adjusting some of the stats provided.


New Item: Frost Spire
- Components: Neophyte’s Book (1000) + Blood Ruby (550) + Apprentice’s Robe (450) + Recipe (500) = 2500 gold.
- +20 Intelligence.
- +200 Max Health.
- Passive: Non-DOT Spell Damage reduces enemy’s Movement Speed by 7% for 2.5 seconds, stacking up to 3 times.


+ The introduction of this item aims to further diversify choices for caster heroes in the early to mid game. Providing them with a unique alternative that brings utility and defensive capabilities hopes to achieve this goal.


Icon of the Goddess - Rework 
- Component buildup changed to: Glowstone (1200) + Neophyte’s Book (1000) + Manatube (850).
* Total cost decreased from 3250 to 3050.
- +250 Max Health.
- +150 Max Mana (450 fully charged).
- +12 Intelligence.
- +125% Mana Regeneration (305% fully charged).
- Passive: Gains a charge and applies Gift of the Goddess (+10 Mana Regeneration and your abilities refresh 1.33x faster) to self for 15 seconds if an enemy hero dies within 1000 range.
- Each Charge grants +20 Max Mana and 12% Mana Regeneration, up to 15 Charges.
- At max charges of 15, gain 75 Cast Speed.
* No longer loses charges upon death.


+ The previous version granting bonuses to Max Health contradicted the high-risk, high-reward mechanic. Shifting the focus of the item towards Mana Regeneration will make it more attractive to a wider variety of heroes that want mana sustain. 
+ The new charge system will promote a unique payoff once obtaining max charges without having to forego the downsides of losing charges when dying.


Psionic Hood - Rework
- Component buildup changed to: Shaman’s Headdress (2050) + Beastheart (1100) + Recipe (500).
* Total cost increased from 3300 to 3650 gold.
- +10 Magic Armor.
- +10 Health Regeneration.
- +15% Stun and Debuff Resistance.
- +15% Cooldown Reduction (Modifier).
- +300 Max Health.
- Passive: Whenever you receive damage, this item gains a charge (up to 100). Reduce incoming Magic Damage by 0.2% per charge. Charges disappear at a pace of 20 per second if you haven’t received any damage in the last 1.5 seconds.


+ Changes made to this item aim to further differentiate from other protective items. The addition of Cooldown Reduction, Bonus Health and the new passive effect granting Magic Damage Reduction will make it a viable alternative for heroes that want to tank damage and continuously stay in the front lines.


Sacrificial Stone
- No longer grants increased healing to Accursed and Jeraziah.


+ This item now only applies bonus healing to ranged heroes.


Spellshards - Rework
- No longer grants 30/45/60% Magic Armor penetration.
- No longer increases Spell Damage vs. non-heroes by 10/15/20%.
- Now grants +8/12/16% increased Magic Damage.


+ The previous iteration of Spellshards was problematic due to scaling Magic Armor penetration along with other benefits it gave for an inexpensive cost. This change will keep the damage output roughly the same against heroes with no Magic Armor items, while lowering its effectiveness against higher Magic Armor targets.


New Item: Storm Lance
- Components: Punchdagger (500) + Wind Whistle (200) + Duck Boots (150) + Recipe (300) = 1150 gold.
- +4 Agility.
- +12 Attack Damage.
- +20 Movement Speed.
- Passive: When moving, gain 1 charge per 12.5 units moved, up to 100 charges. Your next attack deals an additional 0.4 Physical Damage per charge, then removes all charges.


+ This item provides another way of enhancing your ganking potential by increasing your mobility and giving the oomph to your first attack.


Wind Whistle
- Passive Movement Speed no longer stacks with items this builds into (e.g. Energizer, Vitalizer, Storm Lance, Stormspirit).
- The highest valued MS item will take priority.


+ This will limit multiple Wind Whistle built items from stacking their movement speeds together.
